Folder Organizer Script
This Python script helps you organize your directories by scanning through a specified root folder and its subdirectories. It identifies folders containing the keywords "papers" or "paper" and moves them to a designated directory, while deleting non-matching subfolders.

Usage:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone url
Navigate to the script directory:

bash
Copy code
cd folder-organizer-script
Edit the script (organize_folders.py) to set the correct root directory:

python
Copy code
root_directory = "/path/to/your/root/directory"
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python organize_folders.py
Note:
Use this script with caution, especially when dealing with important directories.
Test on a small set of data before applying it to your entire folder structure.
Ensure proper permissions to modify and move files/folders.
